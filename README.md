# web scrape my preffered coffee price changes

I'm using this script to get notified by email when my preferred coffee price has changed

I've modified the initial script to a new one multiple-links.py so you could add more links to the same website to be scrapped
You should create the .txt files initially before running the scipt for the first time.
